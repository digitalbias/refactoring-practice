# Refactoring Practice

Practice going through refactoring book with ruby and just trying some of the things I've learned over the last couple days. Something of a personal improvement project to see if I can get some of the ideas behind DDD and Refactoring to stick.

People are welcome to clone and run with this as much as they want.
