# Refactoring Practice

Practice going through refactoring book with ruby and just trying some of the things I've learned over the last couple days. Something of a personal improvement project to see if I can get some of the ideas behind DDD and Refactoring to stick.

People are welcome to clone and run with this as much as they want.

`bundle install` to get everything setup. From there, you can check out the branches as you please. They should start with `01` and progress from there. My solutions differ from what Martin Fowler has, but I've tried to stay as close as I could. If anything, the tests should be good enough to make whatever else you are doing work.
